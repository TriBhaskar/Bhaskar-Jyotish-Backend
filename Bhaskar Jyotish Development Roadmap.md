## API Structure Recommendations

### Astrologer Registration
```
POST /api/auth/astrologer/register
{
  "email": "astrologer@example.com",
  "password": "password",
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "phone": "+91XXXXXXXXXX",
  "yearsOfExperience": 5,
  "specializations": ["CAREER", "RELATIONSHIPS"],
  "languagesSpoken": ["English", "Hindi"],
  "consultationFeePerHour": 500.00,
  "bio": "Experienced astrologer...",
  "certifications": ["file1.pdf", "file2.pdf"]
}
```

### Customer vs Astrologer Registration Differences
- **Customer:** Basic profile, birth details optional initially
- **Astrologer:** Extended profile, certifications required, approval needed
- **Validation:** Different rules for each user type
- **Workflow:** Customers activate immediately, astrologers need approval

---

## Development Best Practices

1. **API Versioning:** Use `/api/v1/` prefix
2. **Error Handling:** Consistent error response format
3. **Logging:** Comprehensive audit trail
4. **Testing:** Unit tests for each major feature
5. **Documentation:** OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
6. **Security:** JWT tokens, rate limiting, input validation

---

## Database Considerations

Your schema is comprehensive and well-structured. Key points:
- Use the existing `user_role` enum effectively
- Leverage the `astrologer_profiles` table for extended astrologer data
- Implement proper foreign key relationships
- Use the audit_logs table for tracking important changes
